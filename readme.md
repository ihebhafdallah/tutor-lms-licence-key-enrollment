# Tutor LMS Licence Key Enrollment
Tutor LMS Licence Key Enrollment is a WordPress plugin that enhances Tutor LMS by enabling course enrollment through unique license keys. Administrators can generate bulk license keys for specific courses and distribute them to users. Users can then use a simple frontend form to submit their key and gain instant access to the course.

This plugin is ideal for offline sales, corporate training, academic institutions, or any scenario where you need to grant course access without a standard online payment process.

## Features

#### Administrator Features
*   **Bulk Key Generation**: Generate multiple license keys (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 at a time) for any Tutor LMS course.
*   **Key Management Interface**: A dedicated "Licence Keys" menu under Tutor LMS to view and manage all generated keys.
*   **Key Status Tracking**: Keys have a status (`active`, `sent`, `expired`) to help you track their lifecycle.
*   **Filtering & Sorting**: Easily filter keys by course and status, or sort them by creation date.
*   **Bulk Actions**: Update the status of multiple keys at once (e.g., Mark as Sent, Mark as Expired) or delete them in bulk.
*   **CSV Export**: Export all keys or a filtered selection to a CSV file for external record-keeping or distribution.

#### User Features
*   **Simple Enrollment Form**: A clean and straightforward form for users to enter their license key.
*   **Instant Access**: Upon submitting a valid key, users are automatically enrolled in the corresponding course.
*   **User-Friendly Notifications**: Clear success or error messages guide the user through the activation process.

## Requirements
*   WordPress
*   [Tutor LMS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/)
*   [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) (The plugin uses WooCommerce to process the enrollment and create a zero-cost order for record-keeping).
